# Darts Tracker

A custom tracker for the three main games in my darts practice routine. 

This is to analyse how my performance changes across time.


## Practice Games
- Round the World (Singles)
    - Hit each single number on the dartboard in sequence (S1 -> S2 -> S3 etc.)
    - Only when the current single has been hit can the next single be attempted
    - Record how many attempts to hit each single number
- Round the World (Doubles)
    - Throw 3 darts at each double number on the dartboard in sequence (D1 -> D2 -> D3 etc.)
    - Record how many times hit each double number
- 501 (Best of 3 legs)
    - Score and checkout, starting from 501
    - Record key statistics from each leg:
        - Number of darts thrown
        - Three dart average
        - Attempts at checkout
        - Win outcome


## Performance Objectives
- Reduce number of attempts to hit each single number
- Increase number of hits for each double number
- Increase three dart average/scoring average
- Increase checkout percentage
- Increase number of legs won
